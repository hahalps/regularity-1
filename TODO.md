# Research questions

- # of equivalence classes of regexes at each size?
- height vs size

# Implementation

- DFAs?
- equivalence?
  Hopcroft and Karp bisimulation algorithm
- union, intersection, negation
- JIT compile w/LLVM
  given a regex, use LLVM (a compiler framework) to generate code at runtime
  the SUPER EFFICIENTLY recognizes that regular expression
- minimizing DFAs?


# Refactoring

- rename `seq` into `cat`?
